# The Traveler's Cafe

### Restaurant Name Origin
I combined the two words that I've been thinking of lately. Traveler - I was speculating about the ideal travel date to go to Spain or Sout America so I can fully immerse myself with Spanish since I'm currently learning the language. And Cafe - the last goal in my mind was to try out different drinks in countries I desire to visit.
